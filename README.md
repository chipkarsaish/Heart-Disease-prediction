# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based web application to predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on their medical parameters. A regression model from **Scikit-learn** is used to perform the prediction, and the application interface is built using **Flask**. Data preprocessing and manipulation are handled using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

## 🔍 Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and risk assessment can significantly reduce the impact of heart disease. This project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of having heart disease.

The model is trained on a standard heart disease dataset and deployed as an interactive web application, enabling users to input medical information and receive instant predictions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Type**: Regression
- **Library**: Scikit-learn
- **Goal**: Predict the presence or severity of heart disease based on patient attributes.
- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease dataset or similar public dataset
- **Target Variable**: Numerical value indicating likelihood or risk level of heart disease

## 🖥️ Web Application

The web interface allows users to:

- Enter health-related attributes through a form
- Submit data to the backend
- View the predicted risk score for heart disease

The web app is lightweight and built using Flask for simplicity and responsiveness.
